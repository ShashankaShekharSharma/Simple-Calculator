# Calculator Documentation

## Introduction
This is a simple calculator script created by Shashanka Shekhar Sharma and Chaitanya Singh Negi. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, solving quadratic and cubic equations, computing logarithms, calculating factorials, and plotting polynomial graphs.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, cotangent, and their respective inverse functions.
- **Quadratic and Cubic Equations**: Solve quadratic and cubic equations with real and complex roots.
- **Logarithms**: Compute logarithms with specified bases.
- **Factorials**: Calculate the factorial of a given number.
- **Polynomial Graphs**: Plot the graph of a polynomial equation.
- **History Tracking**: Save the history of calculations to a CSV file.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Choose the desired operation from the menu.
3. Follow the prompts to input the necessary values.
4. View the result and choose whether to continue with the current result or start a new operation.
5. Optionally, type "history" to view the history of calculations.

## Instructions
- **History**: Typing "history" at the operation choice prompt will display the history of calculations from the CSV file.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following Python modules:
- `math`: For mathematical operations.
- `csv`: For handling CSV files.
- `os`: For file system operations.
- `time`: For measuring the time spent on the calculator.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.

## CSV File
The calculator saves the history of calculations to a CSV file named "calculator_history.csv." The CSV file contains two columns: "Operation" and "Result."
